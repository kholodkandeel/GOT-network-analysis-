# GOT-network-analysis

used libraries 

-pandas
-networkx

This dataset constitutes a network and is given as a text file describing the edges between characters, with some attributes attached to each edge. Let's start by loading in the data for the first book A Game of Thrones and inspect it.

The weight attribute of every edge tells us the number of interactions that the characters have had over the book, and the book column tells us the book number.
by useing networkx, we'll crreat a graph object for the 1st book.

note: the first book (book[0]) and the fifth book (book[4]).
